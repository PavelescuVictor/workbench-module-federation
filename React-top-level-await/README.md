# React Application with Module Federation

The project contains one **Host** applicaiton and one **Remote** application.
Using *"Module Federation"* to share peices of code between **Host** and **Remote**.

Both **Host** and **Remote** applications setup were created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Both applications use [vite-top-level-await](https://github.com/Menci/vite-plugin-top-level-await) in order to build for *"es2020"* target and not *"esnext"*.

More info is presented in each application *"README.md"* file.
