# React Application with Module Federation

The project contains one **Host** applicaiton and one **Remote** application.
Using *"Module Federation"* to share peices of code between **Host** and **Remote**.

Both **Host** and **Remote** applications setup were created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
The **Remote** application is sharing the whole app as a module to be consumed by the **Host**.

More info is presented in each application *"README.md"* file.
