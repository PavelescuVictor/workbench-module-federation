# Remote Applications

There are a few applications created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## To run each application you should:

- **"npm run build-watch"** This way you are consantly watching for changes in the file and build new ones on changes registered.
- **"npm run serve"** This way you are serving the build files to a local server to be served for hosts

**INFO: Doing these commands in each application directory so each application is locally served on a server and cand be consumed by the host**
