# Module Federation Workbench

An workbench for exploring module federation with different scenarios and examples.

Each aplication setup was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

**Explored scenarios:**
- Shared components between one **Remote** application to a **Host** application.
- Shared while **Remote** app as a module for the **Host** application to consume.
- Shared components between one **Remote** application to a **Host** application when both are built for target *"es2020"* instead of *"esnext"*.

For implementation details read the according *"README.md"* file for each application.
